        <p>Hi, my name is Alison, and I'm from Daly City. I'm majoring in visual communication design and considering minoring in computer science. I've always enjoyed the more artistic subjects in school, and I'd say I am a somewhat creative person, which is why I felt this major was right for me. After I graduate, I would want to get a job relating to UX/UI design. 
            <br> <br> <br>
            I'm a very passionate person when it comes to my interests. Something I love right now is Clairo's music, love herrrrr, and I saw her in concert for the second time last year! I'm definitely hoping to go to more concerts this year. In my free time, I also like to bake, which is a recent hobby I started with my sister where we try to bake every Friday. I also enjoy drawing and painting, I love creating something I've been picturing in my mind. I love music and even started playing guitar 2 years ago and if I'm still passionate about it in the future, I'd love to play more instruments like the bass or drums. Making edits, spending time with friends/family, and watching shows/movies (I'm unfortunately obsessed with Glee) are always fun. I'd love to gain more hobbies and try new things. 
            <br> <br> <br>
             In recent years I've felt determined to set and achieve goals for myself, big or small. Last year, I wanted to work out every day, and for the most part (missing 4 or 5 days), I did, which is something I'm proud of because I've never been the athletic type. In the past, I was also never really a movie-watcher so one year I decided to watch a new movie every day! It honestly felt exhausting at times and I wouldn't do it again, but I want to try to do similar things in the future like listening to a new album every day or finishing a book every month.   </p>
